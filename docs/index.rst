.. PyDynamic_tutorials' documentation master file, which we copied heavily from the
   docs of https://github.com/cornellius-gp/gpytorch, because we liked so
   much the way they presented their tutorials, examples and actual
   documentation of the code side by side.

PyDynamic_tutorials - Assistance in understanding uncertainty propagation with PyDynamic
========================================================================================

Archived
--------

This accompanying selection of tutorials and examples is archived as well as the
upstream project is.

Previously this was meant as a collection of tutorials and examples to document,
explain and illustrate the possibilities offered by
`PyDynamic <https://github.com/PTB-M4D/PyDynamic>`_. As such it is still relevant
for its latest release.

For the *PyDynamic_tutorials* homepage go to
`GitHub <https://github.com/PTB-M4D/PyDynamic_tutorials>`_.

*PyDynamic_tutorials* are written in Python 3.
